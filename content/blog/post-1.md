The process of perfectly fitting a bike to a person’s specifications and preferences can be difficult. Nevertheless, one quick fix that has substantial influence on a cyclist’s comfort is the saddle height. As described in \[Burt (2014)\]([https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/bike-fit-9781408190302/](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/bike-fit-9781408190302/ "https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/bike-fit-9781408190302/")): “Optimum saddle height is described by the natural position of the leg fully extended at the bottom dead centre (BDC) of the pedal stroke” (p. 41). **Using AI we can detect the inner-knee angle and help cyclists adjust their saddles to the proper height.**
